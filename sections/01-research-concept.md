# Research Concept & Direction

Research Problem & Objectives:
Developing next-generation machine learning benchmarks focusing on safety and trustworthiness. Main question: What new evaluation metrics and benchmarks are needed to assess AI system safety and trustworthiness comprehensively?

Knowledge Gap:
Current ML benchmarks inadequately address safety and trustworthiness concerns in modern AI systems. Limited integration of comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Research Goals:
Create novel safety-focused ML benchmarks
Develop trustworthiness evaluation metrics
Build upon existing STAIR lab benchmark foundations
Integrate with broader evaluation ecosystems (HELM)

Scope: Safety and trustworthiness benchmark development with STAIR lab foundation

Expected Contributions: Comprehensive AI safety benchmarks, trustworthiness evaluation frameworks
